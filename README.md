# K2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hongymagic/k2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hongymagic/k2) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hongymagic/k2/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hongymagic/k2) ![Package dependencies](https://david-dm.org/hongymagic/k2.svg)

Koa 2 and GraphQL server that _just works™_. We've climbed the mountain of
boilerplate for you, so you don't have to.

## Getting started

Make sure you have Docker installed as PostgreSQL is run on the docker
container.

```
git clone -o k2 -b master --single-branch https://github.com/hongymagic/k2.git example-api

cd example-api                  # Change current directory to the newly created one
docker-compose up               # Launch all auxiliary services (i.e., PostgresSQL)
cp .env.sample .env             # Configuration on development mode is done via dotenv
yarn migrate:latest             # Run database migrations
yarn seed:run                   # Add some seed data
yarn start:dev                  # Start the server in development mode
```

By default the API server starts on port 5000, http://localhost:5000.

```

## Testing

K2 uses [Facebook Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) so you can add a
directory named `__tests__` at any level and start writing tests.

Root level `tests` directory is reserved for integration tests using supertest.
Currently requires you to run the database server via docker-compose: see above.

```
yarn test
```

And to run coverage:

```
yarn test -- --coverage
```

## Deployments

This is a standard Node.js 7.6+ application. You can deploy it to anywhere you
like including, but not limited to:

- [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now)
- [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)
- Pretty much anything that runs docker or Node.js

### Now.sh

Deploying to now is super simple. Just run:

```
now
```

### AWS ElasticBeanstalk

Simply create a version of AWS EB with Node version 7.6.0 and deploy. I
personally have travis CI deploy it via a `eb` script.

- TODO: Sample `.ebextensions/`
- Database is already configured to prefer `RDS_{HOSTNAME,DB_NAME,USERNAME,PASSWORD}` connection information
